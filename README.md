# Quiz-App-Using-Tkinter
A simple GUI-based quiz application built with Python and Tkinter. Features multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with 4 options, navigation (next/previous), and a final score display with custom messages ("Good", "Very Good", "Excellent") based on performance. Questions are hardcoded (simulating JSON/text file input), and the app auto-closes after showing the score. Includes a light cyan background for a clean look.
